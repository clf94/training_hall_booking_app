          <li>This tool is to have an overview to see who comes at what time on which day in the hall.</li>
          <li>If someone books a slot and wants to play, they must <b>check-in</b> to update the live occupancy so others can see that someone is playing. Don't forget to <b>checkout</b> once finished.</li>
          <li>Bookings can only be <b>deleted by an admin</b>.</li>
          <li>Every user can book for themselves or for a partner. If someone forgot to check-in/out, anyone else can do it instead.</li>
          <li>To guarantee accessibility for everyone, only <b>1 hour per day per user</b> is allowed (two 30-min slots or one full 1-hour slot). Book only if nobody else is using that slot. </li>
          <li>Use check-in/check-out functionality responsibly. If your turn is over and the hall is full, please checkout to allow the next registered player to play. </li>
          <li>You can book for the <b>next two available days</b> (Tue, Thu, Fri). For example, if today is Tue, you can book for today and Thu; if today is Wed, you can book for Thu and Fri.</li>
